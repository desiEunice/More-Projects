## SUMMARY

I use the mathematical framework of Modern Portfolio Theory(MPT) to construct an ideal portfolio of cryptocurrency assets that reduces the risk while simultaneously maximizing the expected returns. In doing so I created 10000 random portfolio and found the weights of the optimal portfolio to be with portfolio with the maximum Sharpe Ratio and minimum risk portfolio has the minimum volatility. <br>
I find that the efficient frontier looked a bit different and that could be attributed to the time period chosen for the analysis and that cryptocurrency assets are fairly new as compared to traditional assets like stocks and bonds.
