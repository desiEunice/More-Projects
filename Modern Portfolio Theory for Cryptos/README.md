## SUMMARY

I use the mathematical framework of Modern Portfolio Theory(MPT) to construct an ideal portfolio of cryptocurrency assets that reduces the risk while simultaneously maximizing the expected returns. In doing so I created 10000 random portfolio and found the weights of the optimal portfolio to be with portfolio with the maximum Sharpe Ratio and minimum risk portfolio has the minimum volatility. <br>
I find that the efficient frontier looked a bit different and that could be attributed to the time period chosen for the analysis and that cryptocurrency assets are fairly new as compared to traditional assets like stocks and bonds.


### Limitations
There are several limitations that come with this model of optimization. Firstly, we assume that the return distribution is normal for the MPT model to work well, which may not be accurate. This may cause us to have inaccurate estimation of risk/volatility since we take standard deviation as proxy for risk.<br>
Secondly, we cannot solely rely on using historical data to guarantee future results. Assuming that past returns may likely continue at the same rate as past data may be inaccurate.


### Future Research
- For future research, we could explore the optimization problem on a quantum annealer.
- We could explore other volatility models such to use as proxy for volatility.
