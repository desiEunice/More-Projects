## Customer Segmentation Project

The goal of this project is to assist us in better understanding customer behavior in a mall through membership cards. The data includes basic information about customers such as their ID, age, gender, annual income, and spending score. Customers are assigned a spending score based on their purchasing data. To do so, we use an unsupervised ML technique known as the KMeans clustering algorithm to group the customers. By better understanding its customers, the mall can design its marketing approach to boost its revenue.
