### PCA

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique is used to reduce the dimensionality of a data set, finding the causes of variability and sorting them by importance. Its general objectives are; data reduction and interpretation.
It reduces the number of variables that are correlated to each other into fewer independent variables without losing the essence of these variables. 



### Yield Curve

The yield curve shows the interest rates the government must pay to borrow money across different maturites.
According to the expectations theory of interest rates, the yield curve is made up of two aspects:
- An average of market expectations concerning future short-term interest rates.
- The term premium — the extra compensation an investor receives for holding a
longer-term bond. This is essentially because of the time value of money — $100 is worth more today than it is worth tomorrow, due to its potential earning capacity due to interest. Therefore, for a fixed-income investment to be worth the extra time the investor must part with their cash, the bond issuer must pay the investor some extra amount.
