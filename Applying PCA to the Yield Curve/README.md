A principal component analysis is concerned with explaining the variance-covariance structure of a set of variables through a few linear combinations of these variables. 
Its general objectives are; data reduction and interpretation.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique is used to reduce the dimensionality of a data set, finding the causes of variability and sorting them by importance. 
It reduces the number of variables that are correlated to each other into fewer independent variables without losing the essence of these variables. 
As PCA is useful to reduce information contained in a big dataset, it makes it easier to interpret by finding the least amount of variables that explain the largest proportion of the data.
It does this by transforming the data from a correlation/covariance matrix onto a subspace with fewer dimensions, where all explanatory variables are orthogonal (linearly independent) to each other, 
i.e there is no multicollinearity.
